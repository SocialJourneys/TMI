============================== SETUP GUIDE ========================================
1. Ensure Oracle JDK-7 is installed
2. Ensure Tomcat7 is installed
3. Ensure Postgres is installed
4. Ensure Phppgadmin is installed
5. Create the appropriate database users and database from PhpPgAdmin interface
6. Drop the war file in the webapps folder of tomcat
7. Start the tomcat

The database connection setting and the twitter credential can be found in the 
following directory of the exploded war file "webapps/{app-name}/WEB-INF/classes". 
However, It is NOT recommendable to tamper with the files there as it is exploded 
each time Tomcat starts up, hence any changes made will be overwritten unless the 
war file is deleted after the files are edited.

Also since the database connection credentials are know ahead of time, it is 
recommended to create a carbon copy of the known credentials - username, 
password and database, on the database server. Every other thing is pretty much 
auto generated when the app runs for the first time, i.e. the database 
schema(generated by hibernate), properties files(generated by app code) etc.
